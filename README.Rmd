[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inbo/wateRinfo.svg?branch=addci)](https://travis-ci.org/inbo/wateRinfo) [![AppVeyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/5ia9va0jyskbvhev/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stijnvanhoey/waterinfo/branch/master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/inbo/wateRinfo/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/inbo/wateRinfo?branch=master)

The goal of wateRinfo is to facilitate access to the variety of data available on [waterinfo.be](https://www.waterinfo.be/) by providing an R-interface to download time series data.

An [API](https://www.waterinfo.be/download/9f5ee0c9-dafa-46de-958b-7cac46eb8c23?dl=0) is provided by waterinfo.be to request time series data. However, this still requires the proper composition of the URL with the identification codes (`Timeseriesgroup_id` and `ts_id`) as used by the system itself. To facilitate the user in searching for stations and variables and consequently download the data of interest, this package provides some general R functions to download the `waterinfo.be` data.

## Installation

You can install wateRinfo from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("inbo/wateRinfo")
```

When succesfull, load it as usual:

```{r load_lib}
library(wateRinfo)
```

## Example

For a number of supported variables ([documented](https://www.waterinfo.be/download/9f5ee0c9-dafa-46de-958b-7cac46eb8c23?dl=0) by VMM), the stations providing time series data for a given variable can be listed with the command `get_stations`.

If you want to know the supported variables, ask for the supported variables:

```{r var_listing}
supported_variables("en")
```

Listing the available air_pressure stations:

```{r station_listing}
get_stations("air_pressure")
```

Each of the stations in the list for a given variable, are represented by a `ts_id`. These can be used to download the data of a given period with the command `get_timeseries_tsid`, for example Overpelt (`ts_id = 78124042`):

```{r download_pressure}
overpelt_pressure <- get_timeseries_tsid("78124042", 
                                         from = "2017-04-01", 
                                         to = "2017-04-02")
head(overpelt_pressure)
```

Making a plot of the data with ggplot:

```{r plot_pressure, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(overpelt_pressure, aes(x = Timestamp, y = Value)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    xlab("") + ylab("hPa") + 
    scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%H:%M\n%Y-%m-%d", date_breaks = "6 hours")
```

```{r showplot1, fig.width = 7, echo = FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-plot_pressure-1.png")
```

Another option is to check the available variables for a given station, with the function `get_variables`. Let's consider again Overpelt (`ME11_002`) and check the first ten available variables at the Overpelt measurement station:

```{r var_overpelt, message = FALSE}
vars_overpelt <- get_variables("ME11_002")
head(vars_overpelt, 10)
```

Different pre-calculated variables are already available and a `ts_id` value is available for each of them to download the corresponding data. For example, `DagGem` (= daily mean values) of `RH` (= relative humidity), i.e. `ts_id = 78382042`:

```{r download_rh}
overpelt_rh_daily <- get_timeseries_tsid("78382042", 
                                         from = "2017-04-01", 
                                         to = "2017-04-30")
head(overpelt_rh_daily)
```

```{r plot_rh, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(overpelt_rh_daily, aes(x = Timestamp, y = Value)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    xlab("") + ylab(" RH (%)") + 
    scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b-%d\n%Y", date_breaks = "5 days")
```

```{r showplot2, fig.width = 7, echo = FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-plot_rh-1.png")
```

Unfortunately, not all variables are documented, for which the check for the appropriate variable is not (yet) fully supported by the package.

More detailed tutorials are available in the package vignettes!

## Note on restrictions of the downloads

The amount of data downloaded from waterinfo.be is limited via a credit system. When you require more extended data requests, please request a download token from the waterinfo.be site administrators via the e-mail adress <hydrometrie@waterinfo.be> with a statement of which data and how frequently you would like to download data. You will then receive a client-credit code that can be used to obtain a token that is valid for 24 hours, after which the token can be refreshed with the same client-credit code.

Get token with client-credit code: (limited client-credit code for testing purposes)

```{r token_receive}
client <- paste0("MzJkY2VlY2UtODI2Yy00Yjk4LTljMmQtYjE2OTc4ZjBjYTZhOjRhZGE4",
                 "NzFhLTk1MjgtNGI0ZC1iZmQ1LWI1NzBjZThmNGQyZA==")
my_token <- get_token(client = client)
print(my_token)
```

Receive information on the validity of the token:

```{r token_expired}
is.expired(my_token)
```

Check when the token expires:

```{r token_expires_when}
expires.in(my_token)
```

Use token when retrieving data:

```{r use_expires_when}
get_stations(variable_name = "verdamping_monteith", token = my_token)
```
